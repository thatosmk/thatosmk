## Welcome to my GitHub page! 

My name is Thato Semoko. Kindly see my profile here.

:wave: -  I'm a Fullstack Ruby and Rails.

:heart_eyes: - I love software development & currently working at [Platform45](https://platform45.com)

I founded [Serobe](https://serobe.co.za) in my last years in university and it has since grown into a SAAS product that I am proud of as a solo-founder. It is an all-in-one residence management software, used by university residences to manage their day-to-day operations and interactions with students/tenants.

I am passionate about mentorship, in fact, I am writing a [guide](https://github.com/thatosmk/engineering-mentor) on how to do it right in an engineering enviroment.
