## Welcome to my GitHub page!
My name is Thato Semoko and I am a Software Engineer. Kindly see my profile here.

👋 - I'm a Fullstack Ruby and Rails.

😍 - I love software development & currently working at AgrigateOne

I founded [Serobe](https://serobe.co.za/?utm_source=github) in my last years in university and it has since grown into a SAAS product that I am proud of as a solo-founder. It is an all-in-one residence management software, used by university residences to manage their day-to-day operations and interactions with students/tenants.
